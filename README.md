Class-Assignments
=================

All the class assignments from my introduction to programming course and data structures and algorithms course.

Description
-----------

These are my solutions to the assignments encountered during my introduction to programming course, as well as my data structures
and algorithms course at the American University of Beirut.

They are all written in c++, and cover most of the basic concepts of programming. Issues tackled range from simple tasks such as using string
manipulation techniques and creating classes and points, to more complicated tasks involving link lists, stacks, and binary search trees.

The assignment instructions are included for most of the excersises. The instructions for data structure exercises are not unfortunately unavailable,
as well as the instructions for the quizzes and final exam.

Assignments that contain multiple exercises have only one exercise working, while the others are commented out. This was done for demonstrative purposes.
